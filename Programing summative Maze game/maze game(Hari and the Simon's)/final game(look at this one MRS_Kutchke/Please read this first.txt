The game is almost complete.
When i get the components from Simon i will be able to make it look like the person is moving and we will be adding more 
levels. An intro screen will also be added and will provide adequate instructions on how to play the game properly. 
I could not fully complete because the images i needed had a white background in it and i need Simon to convert it into a
 png without a backgroung. It will be complete for the gand reveal to the g5. 

Adding more levels will be easy, i can reuse the code, just will have to rearrange the lables in the maze. 
As per adding moving annimations, i have done it once before on the school computers, but i could not do it thins one becasue 
i do not have the right images.
